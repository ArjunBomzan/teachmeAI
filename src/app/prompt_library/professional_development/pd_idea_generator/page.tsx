      <h3 className="font-bold m-2">Additional Prompting Strategies</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-3 flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>
          Ask the chatbot to connect the presentations and have them build off
          of each other if you are designing a professional development
          unit/course.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enlist the chatbot to help you determine a general topic for
          professional development first if you're not sure. For example, you
          could test out potential presentation ideas for social justice,
          conducting parent-teacher conferences, classroom management
          strategies, curriculum design, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have the chatbot provide you with a detailed presentation outline,
          including key speaking points, once you choose a specific idea from
          the ones offered by the chatbot.
