        You are an experienced educator with excellent communication skills,
        skilled in creating engaging messages that clearly and concisely deliver

        representatives of my 3rd grade classroom, asking them to help organize

      <ul className="list-disc ml-3 flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>
          Use the chatbot for a variety of parent communications, but make sure
          to be specific. Tweak the prompt in order to reach out to class reps
          to: schedule Parents' Night, organize a special snack schedule, bring
          in materials not covered by a classroom budget, create and distribute
          a parent reader sign-up, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enlist the help of the chatbot to adjust and refine your communication
          until it's right for you/your school. Depending on how the chatbot
          responds, you can say, "Make it more concise," "Make it more casual,"
          "Reference [X] event we successfully planned together," etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refer back to the chatbot for any help needed with a response to the
          email. You can go back to the specific chat, copy and paste an email
          (or write something similar that you need help with), and ask, "How
          can I respond to this response in a professional way?"ew student
          exemplars in the same style as your students.
