      <h3 className="font-bold m-2">Additional Prompting Strategies</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-3 flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>
          Use the chatbot to help your students achieve their goal by creating a
          schedule, monthly plan, SMART goals, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add specific information whenever possible to personalize the
          chatbotâ€™s responses avoiding personally identifiable information.. For
          example, ask for suggestions for management of stress and anxiety for
          students with ADHD who find meditation and sitting still very
          difficult. Or meal prep ideas when you have specific food allergies
          and preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have the chatbot help you create lessons around specific mental health
          topics that your students are struggling to comprehend.
