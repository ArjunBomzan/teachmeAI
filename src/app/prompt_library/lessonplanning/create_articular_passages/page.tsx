        You are an expert speech language pathologist, highly skilled in

      <h3 className="font-bold m-2">Additional Prompting Strategies</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-3 flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>
          Enlist the chatbot to be specific and creative with your prompt theme
          preference in order to make it unique and engaging for your students.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the chatbot for ideas on how to incorporate visual aids. In the
          example above, you could use pictures of Marvel characters or scenes
          from the Avengers movies. Depending on what the passage is, ask the
          chatbot for visual aid ideas to support comprehension and engagement,
          especially for younger or visual learners.
        </li>

        <li>
          Ask the chatbot to differentiate the prompt depending on your
          studentâ€™s articulation needs. In the example above, you could have the
          chatbot focus more or less on the vocalic /r/ sounds in the initial,
          medial, or final parts of a word depending on what word positions the
          student struggles to articulate the sound
